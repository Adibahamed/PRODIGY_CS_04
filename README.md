# Basic Keylogger

A simple Python-based keylogger program that records and logs keystrokes to a text file. This project uses the `pynput` library to capture keystrokes and save them for later analysis or testing purposes.

> **Note**: This project is strictly for educational purposes. Using keyloggers without explicit permission is illegal and unethical.

## Features

- Logs every keystroke in real-time
- Saves data to a local text file (`key_log.txt`) for later review
- Recognizes and logs special keys (e.g., `Enter`, `Space`) separately for readability

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `pynput` library
